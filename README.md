## Sales Performance Overview
A fictional company has experienced a steady decline in sales over the past three years, which has raised concerns. As a data analyst, I was tasked with analyzing three years of historical sales data to uncover insights and identify potential causes

## Objective
To design and develop a dynamic, visually engaging, and informative Sales Dashboard in Excel that empowers stakeholders to monitor performance, identify trends, and make data-driven decisions across products, regions, and timeframes.

## Business Questions:
•	How has sales performed over the past years?

•	Which regions have the highest/lowest sales, and what factors contribute to these trends?

•	Can we predict future sales based on historical trends coupling strategic marketing implementations?
   
## Data Description
This is an e-commerce data  sourced from Kaggle and structured in a .csv file. 

## Plan: 
•	Use power query to clean and process data.

•	Use Excel to analyzed and design a compelling dashboard.

## Cleaning Steps: 
Loaded the dataset into power query

•	*Rename some columns*

•	*Remove duplicates*

•	*Remove NA values in critical columns*

•	*Drop some columns*

•	*Create new columns (profit, Quarter etc.)*

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- *Histogram was employed during the EDA stage to visualize data spread, identify anomalies, and support data cleaning decisions.* 
- Key performance indicators (KPIs) including total sales, total profit, total quantity and year-over-year(YoY%) was established.
